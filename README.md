Jason's toy model for LSTM Neural network using Keras
This is a simple example for making a LSTM neural network. Here is the link for the LSTM network paper: https://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/2604.pdf
LSTM is important in predicting the future, as well as time series. The popular RNN(recurrent neural network) belongs to the LSTM.
I create this simple example to show how to write LSTM using the keras interface. Hope this will help beginner like me to learn how to use it.
